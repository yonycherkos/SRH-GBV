November 5 at 11:30 AM ·

Simply Online is pleased to announce our second Guest Speaker.

Alia Whitney-Johnson is an experienced social entrepreneur with fifteen years of experience working with children who’ve endured trauma, sexual abuse, and exploitation.

During the summer of 2005, at the age of 19, Alia arrived in Sri Lanka as a tsunami-relief volunteer. During this trip, she encountered a heartbreaking reality: Girls as young as 11 who had survived rape or incest and had the courage to stand up for themselves in court were often cast out of their own families and placed in protective shelters away from society where they had little access to education or support.

That summer, she launched Emerge (www.emergeglobal.org) as a way to connect the girls to critical life and business skills, healing resources, and a community of support. Since then, Emerge has gone on to serve over 1,100 powerful young women.

Alia is also the Co-Founder and Executive Director of Freedom Forward (www.Freedom-Forward.org), a non-profit that is working to prevent the commercial sexual exploitation of youth in San Francisco through systems change. Through this role, she served as the Co-Chair of San Francisco’s Youth Trafficking Committee for the Mayor’s Task Force on Anti-Human Trafficking in 2017 and 2018, where she started the task force’s first Youth Advisory Board. She also helped form a collaborative of organizations to provide a full continuum of wrap-around services to youth who have or may experience commercial sexual exploitation.

Previously, Alia served as a consultant at McKinsey & Company and worked at LeanIn.org. She has served on several boards including the MIT Corporation (MIT’s board of trustees), SERES Global, Emerge Lanka Foundation, and ATHack!. Whitney-Johnson holds a B.S. in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an MPhil in Development Studies from the University of Oxford, where she studied as a Rhodes Scholar.",We are so excited for our amazing founder who will be speaking with the dynamic ladies at Simply Unique!

Judicial Medical Officers and #Police have been exposed conducting forced #anal and #vaginal examinations on #LGBT Sri Lankans. These exams are done to “prove” #homosexuality and to use as evidence to prosecute LGBT people.

These exams are degrading, cruel and amounts to torture. They have been banned by world bodies including the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Medical Association - WMA. The Sri Lanka Medical Association and Sri Lanka Medical Council are yet to issue any statement condemning these cruel exams. There is no requirement in law to conduct them and the #JusticeMinistry must request all their #JMOs to stop conducting them. The #AttorneyGeneral must also direct all Police to stop arresting and harassing #LGBT people.

In one case the JMO put two of his fingers inside the vaginas of both a #transgenderman and a cis #woman asked them if it hurt. They were also subject to more physical examinations in front of other male nurses and doctors. When they pleaded with the doctor not to insert his fingers inside again, the doctor said that he will light a firecracker next.

It is ironic that the Police want to #prosecute LGBT people for consensual relationships by getting doctors to forcefully probe our anus’ and vaginas with their fingers. It’s very clear here who has committed the offence, and it’s not us! Only perverts order and conduct these exams.

Great work by Daily Mirror in exposing these practices and violations. We can only hope for justice for LGBT people and the victims of these examinations.

In the last 24 hours, 3 girl children were brutally #raped and #killed in Sri Lanka! Most of the accused are young men below the age of 30.

Child sexual abuse and rape is endemic in #SriLanka with the police, courts and education authorities still doing very little to stem the problem.

The average rape case takes 14 years in Sri Lanka with only 1 rape conviction in 2018.

What kind of men are coming out of our schools? What exactly are our schools teaching them for them to be raping and killing young baby girls?

In 2019, the then Government withdrew an age appropriate #sexeducation book for children because of some made up cultural sensitivity.

In 2018, the members of the present Sri Lankan Government, while in opposition, falsely accused Think Equal of trying to spread #homosexuality to young children.

#ThinkEqual was actually teaching children values such as #respect, #kindness and #compassion. The programme was created out of the need to end violence against women following the brutal gang rape of a medical student in a bus in Delhi.

The failures by our political leaders to address these issues and their active participation to prevent solutions make them responsible for the crimes against these girls.

Where is the justice for our girls and women?",,"Aritha Wickramasinghe
