Justice Initiative has been operating in Russia since 2001 and the project provides legal support to Russian citizens seeking justice for human rights abuses in both local courts and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Justice Initiative also works in Russia’s North Caucasus, documenting abuses by law enforcement and the military, and gender discrimination. The project presented the case of Valeria Volodina to the ECHR, according to which the Strasbourg Court in 2019 issued the first ruling on domestic violence in Russia.

Imani loved sciences and geography and wanted to work as a doctor or a nurse when she completed her studies.

Imani represents tens of thousands of adolescent school-going girls in Tanzania who can longer access education owing to the ban prohibiting pregnant girls and teenage mothers from attending school.

And despite numerous efforts urging Tanzania to lift the ban, lack of political will has been a great obstacle.

We, in collaboration with our partners, have therefore today filed a case against Tanzania at the African Court on Human and People’s Rights in Arusha to challenge this policy and have it lifted.

10158535209849584,"An analysis of Kuwait’s Penal Code released today by Equality Now and Abolish Article 153, reveals the extent to which Kuwait’s laws are failing to protect women and girls:

➡️ Article 182 allows rapists to escape punishment by marrying the woman or girl they raped, a provision actively condones and rewards sexual violence

➡️ Article 153 provides a lenient sentence for a man who kills his female relatives, a provision rooted in valuing ‘honor’ over the human rights of women and girls;

➡️ the Penal Code does not explicitly criminalize marital rape, leaving women vulnerable to sexual violence committed with impunity

➡️ and the definition of rape is reliant on the use of force, threats or deception rather than being grounded in consent.

It’s time to abolish laws that see women and girls as vessels of their family’s honor, and build an equal world that works for our mothers, our sisters, our daughters, our friends, our communities. Join Kuwaiti activists calling for reform today.
