▶️ “At a time when the COVID-19 pandemic had meant many NHS services were restricted and waiting times soared, the waiting time for medical abortion was reduced by 4.2 days.”

🔴Body confidence is defined as the way we feel about our appearance. Being confident with your body means that you are happy with the way you look and with what your body is capable of doing.

🔴Spending time on social media can have a significant impact on our body confidence and our body image. Being that people are spending more time on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic, we must highlight the differences between what we see online and what is reality.

🔴There is a significant number of men and women who compare themselves with images they see online, and these comparisons tend to be unfavourable. We must collectively be aware of the reality behind social media, whilst also following pages that have a positive impact on our well being rather than pages that negatively impact our body image.","What is body confidence?🤔

What is a mammogram?
➡️ A mammogram can be described as taking an x-ray picture of your breasts, and is very important in finding cancer early. Remember that the pros outweigh the cons when it comes to screening, it is better to detect any lumps early rather than not detecting them at all!

Women between the ages of 50-69 are eligible for screening as part of the National Screening programme. If you feel or see any changes in your breasts that you are concerned about speak to your family doctor.

You may also contact the Mater Dei Hospital Breast clinic on 25454573 or 25454433!",,2020-10-26 14:00:10,https://scontent.fadd1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/122753589_3721005157909748_907208873721005768_n.png?_nc_cat=109&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=h-x8ntvMjdUAX8JfLBC&_nc_ht=scontent.fadd1-1.fna&oh=c5ca22a554044a05e3bd63abb00aef3c&oe=6040D208,,,,2.0,0.0,0,https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3721053157904948&id=237421119601520,,237421119601520,['https://scontent.fadd1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/122753589_3721005157909748_907208873721005768_n.png?_nc_cat=109&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=h-x8ntvMjdUAX8JfLBC&_nc_ht=scontent.fadd1-1.fna&oh=c5ca22a554044a05e3bd63abb00aef3c&oe=6040D208']

Our next theme in our Pink October Campaign is 'Breast Self-Examination'. Self-examining your breasts can be an important way to detect any lumps, hence detecting any possible cancerous lumps, early on. It is a very useful and important screening tool that should be performed in combination with the regular mammograms, and physical examination by your doctor.

This self-exam should be made part of your regular routine, and should be performed at least once a month. Regular examination will make you more familiar with what your breasts are like normally, so if a lump is present it will be noticed easily.

Do not hesitate to call your doctor if you've noticed a lump or any other breast changes👩‍⚕️

3514396625237270,"85% of sexual assault victims in Malta do not report the crime to authorities.

What is sexual assault? It is to force someone into sexual activity when they are unwilling, using violence, threatening behaviour, power or coercion. Sexual assault does not necessarily include the act of sex and can also occur when the victim is unable to give consent. Absence of the word ‘no’, does not necessarily mean ‘yes’ and is not defined as consent.

Forms of sexual assault include rape, marital rape, child sexual abuse, elderly sexual assault, groping, kissing and sexual harassment, with all the above causing severe, often, long-lasting psychological problems with the victims such as depression, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, and addiction. That would be in addition to the physical effects suffered such as physical trauma and unwanted pregnancies.

Many victims are invalidated, and even shamed, being told that it was their fault. This may affect how, and whether, they report what had happened to them to the authorities, either to avoid reliving the trauma of the assault or due to social stigma of being a victim.

In depositing the official instrument of ratification, His Excellency Penda Naanda, stated: “The adoption of Convention No.190 has introduced an important overall framework within which Namibia can address deep-seeded social problems that have a unique impact on the World of Work. For many years, our country has been grappling with the problem of sexual and gender-based violence and harassment. The legacy of apartheid in the form of racist violence and harassment is unfortunately still alive, particularly in the world of work, and bullying and various forms of behaviors that inflict physical, emotional, and/or economic harm persist.""

#16днів активізму проти насильства щодо жінок тривають. КВПУ закликає об'єднати зусилля, щоб зупинити та попередити насильство будь-якої форми на роботі!

🛡 Наші профспілкові організації намагаються захищати працівниць та працівників від домагань та різних форм насильства, використовуючи наявні механізми колективного захисту та чинне законодавство. Проте, практика показує, що нам необхідні більш ефективні інструменти.

📢Саме тому КВПУ закликає ухвалити Конвенцію МОП №190 ""Про викорінення насильства та домагань у сфері праці"" і відповідну Рекомендацію №206.

❓Чому?
Конвенція МОП №190 насильство та домагання у сфері праці визначає як:
⛔ «низку неприйнятних форм поведінки і практик або їх загроз – чи то одиничний або повторюваний випадок – ціллю, результатом або можливим наслідком яких є нанесення фізичної, психологічної, сексуальної або економічної шкоди, включаючи ґендерно обумовлені насильство та домагання».

🛡 Згідно з її положеннями, працівники повинні бути захищені: •На місці роботи (а також в громадських місцях і в приватних приміщеннях, коли вони є місцем роботи)
•У місцях отримання зарплат, для перервою на відпочинок або прийому їжі
• У санітарно-побутових приміщеннях, роздягальнях
•Під час відрядження, поїздок, професійної підготовки, заходів або соціальної діяльності
•Під час комунікацій, пов'язаних з трудовою діяльністю
•У житлових приміщеннях, що надаються роботодавцем
•Під час поїздок на роботу і з роботи

❓Чому боротьба з насильством і домаганням та ухвалення Конвенції МОП №190 важливі?
Це:
❗Захист прав, гідності, фізичного і ментального здоров'я працівниць/ків
❗Покращення продуктивності підприємств, установ та організацій

#16днів активізму проти насильства щодо жінок тривають. КВПУ закликає об'єднати зусилля, щоб зупинити та попередити насильство будь-якої форми на роботі!

🛡 Наші профспілкові організації намагаються захищати працівниць та працівників від домагань та різних форм насильства, використовуючи наявні механізми колективного захисту та чинне законодавство. Проте, практика показує, що нам необхідні більш ефективні інструменти.

📢Саме тому КВПУ закликає ухвалити Конвенцію МОП №190 ""Про викорінення насильства та домагань у сфері праці"" і відповідну Рекомендацію №206.

❓Чому?
Конвенція МОП №190 насильство та домагання у сфері праці визначає як:
⛔ «низку неприйнятних форм поведінки і практик або їх загроз – чи то одиничний або повторюваний випадок – ціллю, результатом або можливим наслідком яких є нанесення фізичної, психологічної, сексуальної або економічної шкоди, включаючи ґендерно обумовлені насильство та домагання».

🛡 Згідно з її положеннями, працівники повинні бути захищені: •На місці роботи (а також в громадських місцях і в приватних приміщеннях, коли вони є місцем роботи)
•У місцях отримання зарплат, для перервою на відпочинок або прийому їжі
• У санітарно-побутових приміщеннях, роздягальнях
•Під час відрядження, поїздок, професійної підготовки, заходів або соціальної діяльності
•Під час комунікацій, пов'язаних з трудовою діяльністю
•У житлових приміщеннях, що надаються роботодавцем
•Під час поїздок на роботу і з роботи

❓Чому боротьба з насильством і домаганням та ухвалення Конвенції МОП №190 важливі?
Це:
❗Захист прав, гідності, фізичного і ментального здоров'я працівниць/ків
❗Покращення продуктивності підприємств, установ та організацій
❗Зменшення державних витрат та сприяння зростанню ВВП країни

We Signed up for Domestic Labor, Not Domestic Abuse

On the International Day to End Violence Against Women, we think of women workers, who are the predominant population engaged in domestic work, paid, underpaid, and unpaid.

Under COVID-19, people are asked to abide by social isolation, but for domestic workers, domestic confinement transforms to domestic abuse. Because of the nature of their work, domestic workers are often forced into silence when they experience violence and abuse at the hands of their employers.

The IDWF demands that solid measures are taken by governmental agencies and civil societies alike, to ensure the respect and recognition of the human, labor, and women rights of the workers.

✊ It is Domestic Work, Not Domestic Violence.

🌍 During the 2020 Campaign, we amplified the issues and demands of 740 million informal women workers who have been acutely impacted by COVID-19. Many of these workers are also migrants, including street vendors, waste pickers, agricultural workers, domestic workers, sex workers & others.

🤝 On this day, we stand in solidarity with women migrant workers everywhere to demand full recognition of their basic human rights, which includes the right to freedom from violence and harassment in the world of work. #NoMoreMissingRights

3404204779646097,"We start our Pagume Activism today!
Just like the past three years during Pagume Activism 4.0 will discuss intensively about issues with regards to Gender in our country.

Aim?
Pretty simple, having conversations that matter to bring about Gender Equality.

Our Topics?
This year we have two topics, each for two days. This way we can discuss in depth of the topics;

Pagume 1 & 2 (Sep6&7) - Womanhood
Pagume 3 & 4 (Sep6&9) - Policy Making and Gender
And finally share our new year wishes on the last day.

ዛሬ የጷጉሜ ንቅናቄን ጀመርን!

ልክ እንዳለፉት ሶስት ዓመታት በአራተኛው ዙር የ #ጷጉሜንቅናቄ በሀገራችን ስላሉ የስርዓተ-ፆታ ጉዳዮች/ችግሮች በጥልቀት እንወያያለን

አላማው?
እጅግ ቀላል ነው፤ ትርጉም ያላቸው ውይይቶችን በማድረግ የምንፈልገውን ለውጥ ማምጣት።

ርዕሶቻችን?
በዚህ ዓመት ሁለት ርዕሰ-ጉዳዮች አሉን። በጥልቀት መወያየት እንድንችል አንድ ርዕስ ለሁለት ቀናት የሚቆይ ይሆናል፦

ጷጉሜ 1 እና 2 - ሴትነት
ጷጉሜ 3 እና 4 - ፖሊሲ አቀራረፅ በስርዓተ-ፆታ አይን
በመጨረሻም (ጷጉሜ 5) ለመጪው ዓመት መልካም ምኞታችንን እንገልፃለን

A MESSAGE FROM THE CREATORS OF SAGA

The celebration of AWARE’s 35th birthday in 2020 called for a reflection on its transformation from modest volunteer group to flourishing NGO and civil society leader in Singapore. In pinpointing the moment that marked the close of the former and the beginning of the latter, there was never any doubt: It was the AWARE Saga. That existential threat (of AWARE being taken over by a group of religious conservatives) pushed its leaders to renew their commitment to feminist advocacy, and strengthen the organisation’s capacity and infrastructure.

We wanted to document the complete history of the Saga for a few reasons. For one, because the lived experience of it was so much richer than what most people saw in the news. And it is important for AWARE to contextualise its ongoing fight for gender equality, to remind itself why the fight matters.

But beyond AWARE, the story of the Saga is important for Singapore—whose citizens pledge tolerance, diversity and democracy in the abstract, but rarely get a chance to test those principles on a national stage. This narrative deals with subject matter that is traditionally considered sensitive in the Singapore context, such as religion and LGBTQ rights. We know that these topics will likely elicit strong feelings in listeners, and have endeavoured to deal with them honestly and with the sensitivity that they deserve. We also believe that our society is sufficiently mature to engage in respectful conversations on these subjects. There are profound lessons to be learnt from the AWARE Saga, about how to disagree constructively and bridge entrenched divides. We hope that new generations carry these lessons forward in the perennial quest to live together in harmony and dignity.

Over the course of this project, we interviewed 50 people. Some of them were experts who provided nuanced, dispassionate insights on the broader socio-political context underlying the events. But most of them were people who had directly participated in the Saga. Living through the Saga was as traumatic as it was invigorating—these interviewees made that clear to us. But while others would have chosen to sweep their trauma under a rug, they recognised the value in putting their experiences on the record. With Bharati Jagdish at the mic, asking unsparingly tough questions, interviewees revisited their triumphs and their mistakes. They relived extremes of emotion: blinding fury, soaring relief, the bitterness of betrayal. We thank them for their honesty and trust.

There are, of course, perspectives that are missing from the assembly of voices—people who declined our invitations to participate. While we regret that we could not interview them, wherever possible we have tried to feature their own words: recordings of meetings, interviews, press conferences, letters, emails and so on. We hope that, in doing so, we have made reasonable effort to present their point of view accurately.

To end: What a privilege it has been to memorialise this remarkable event—and in a medium as intimate and alive as a podcast. May the Saga inspire you as much as it inspires us.

3785658051446606,"We agree with this commentary: Family caregivers of older Singaporeans need help easing their burden of care.

However, the writer fails to identify a major source of stress––financial stress––or offer recommendations on how caregivers can be financially supported to provide care. Our 2019 #MakeCareCount study found that providing care to older persons is likely to compromise the retirement adequacy of caregivers. The surveyed caregivers were forced to completely or partially withdraw from the labour force (spending a median of nine years outside the labour force), and suffer an accompanying loss in income, which they later struggled to recoup. Many caregivers we spoke to said that their stress would be mitigated through an allowance that recognises the work they are doing, i.e. care work.

Accordingly, we’ve recommended the introduction of a Caregiver Support Grant, which varies by the number of activities of daily living with which the care recipient requires assistance, and takes the salaries of paid care workers as a reference point.

What’s more, the commentary’s suggested “one holistic care model” for caregivers and care recipients leaves out migrant domestic workers. No discussion on caregiving is complete without considering both unpaid family caregivers AND domestic workers employed to provide care. MDWs, much like family caregivers, also face a caregiver burden. We need to be concerned about their well-being too, because their ability to deal with caregiver-related stress affects their ability to provide high-quality care to our loved ones.

3782638465081898,"Statement about Theodore Hopf sexual harassment case at NUS

We are happy to see NUS respond with alacrity to an anonymous complaint they received about sexual harassment. Although the university has come under a lot of flak recently for its handling of sexual harassment cases, its decisive action in the case of Prof. Ted Hopf is a clear indication that NUS is taking public feedback to heart.

We want to highlight three actions that hopefully signal a new approach at NUS:

1) NUS ensured that its decision to sack Prof. Hopf was communicated to students and the wider NUS community at the same time as the media. In the previous case regarding Jeremy Fernando, communications to the NUS community were not handled as well.

2) NUS made a police report after speaking to the survivor, and explained in its press statement that it was legally obliged to, under Section 424 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

3) NUS put interim measures into place while the investigations were being conducted—Prof. Hopf was not allowed to contact any students during that period.

We are glad that the university prioritised student safety in this case and did not make any compromises in order to keep Ted Hopf in its employ. While it may be concerning that so many campus sexual harassment cases have emerged of late, we are also glad, at least, that survivors are proving more willing to come forward. It can be difficult and intimidating to file sexual harassment complaints against well-known, well-regarded men, such as Prof. Hopf (who was the top political scientist at NUS). We commend the bravery of those involved.","Statement about Theodore Hopf sexual harassment case at NUS

Building upon our 2019 #MakeCareCount report on family caregivers, this qualitative study was based on interviews with 25 domestic workers providing eldercare, as well as a range of employers, employment agencies and training providers. We found that three major factors for domestic workers' caregiver burden were overwork (14.5 work hours a day on average), inaccurate job matching and inadequate informational/emotional support.

Our recommendations to ameliorate the situation include strengthening legislative protection over domestic workers' working conditions, improving categorisation of skills and care needs for better matching, expanding formal eldercare training and creating targeted support resources.

Simply Unique added a new photo to the album: SIMPLY ONLINE — with Alia Whitney-Johnson at Emerge Global.
November 5 at 11:30 AM ·

Simply Online is pleased to announce our second Guest Speaker.

Alia Whitney-Johnson is an experienced social entrepreneur with fifteen years of experience working with children who’ve endured trauma, sexual abuse, and exploitation.

During the summer of 2005, at the age of 19, Alia arrived in Sri Lanka as a tsunami-relief volunteer. During this trip, she encountered a heartbreaking reality: Girls as young as 11 who had survived rape or incest and had the courage to stand up for themselves in court were often cast out of their own families and placed in protective shelters away from society where they had little access to education or support.

That summer, she launched Emerge (www.emergeglobal.org) as a way to connect the girls to critical life and business skills, healing resources, and a community of support. Since then, Emerge has gone on to serve over 1,100 powerful young women.

Alia is also the Co-Founder and Executive Director of Freedom Forward (www.Freedom-Forward.org), a non-profit that is working to prevent the commercial sexual exploitation of youth in San Francisco through systems change. Through this role, she served as the Co-Chair of San Francisco’s Youth Trafficking Committee for the Mayor’s Task Force on Anti-Human Trafficking in 2017 and 2018, where she started the task force’s first Youth Advisory Board. She also helped form a collaborative of organizations to provide a full continuum of wrap-around services to youth who have or may experience commercial sexual exploitation.

Previously, Alia served as a consultant at McKinsey & Company and worked at LeanIn.org. She has served on several boards including the MIT Corporation (MIT’s board of trustees), SERES Global, Emerge Lanka Foundation, and ATHack!. Whitney-Johnson holds a B.S. in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an MPhil in Development Studies from the University of Oxford, where she studied as a Rhodes Scholar.",We are so excited for our amazing founder who will be speaking with the dynamic ladies at Simply Unique!

Judicial Medical Officers and #Police have been exposed conducting forced #anal and #vaginal examinations on #LGBT Sri Lankans. These exams are done to “prove” #homosexuality and to use as evidence to prosecute LGBT people.

These exams are degrading, cruel and amounts to torture. They have been banned by world bodies including the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Medical Association - WMA. The Sri Lanka Medical Association and Sri Lanka Medical Council are yet to issue any statement condemning these cruel exams. There is no requirement in law to conduct them and the #JusticeMinistry must request all their #JMOs to stop conducting them. The #AttorneyGeneral must also direct all Police to stop arresting and harassing #LGBT people.

In one case the JMO put two of his fingers inside the vaginas of both a #transgenderman and a cis #woman asked them if it hurt. They were also subject to more physical examinations in front of other male nurses and doctors. When they pleaded with the doctor not to insert his fingers inside again, the doctor said that he will light a firecracker next.

It is ironic that the Police want to #prosecute LGBT people for consensual relationships by getting doctors to forcefully probe our anus’ and vaginas with their fingers. It’s very clear here who has committed the offence, and it’s not us! Only perverts order and conduct these exams.

Great work by Daily Mirror in exposing these practices and violations. We can only hope for justice for LGBT people and the victims of these examinations.

Suzanne is one such mentor that we've been lucky to have on our side since March this year. Suzanne joined us with experience in teaching children of all ages for over 23 years. Naturally motivated with the greatest attitude any educator can have, Suzanne is always encouraging those around her with a jolly mood.

In the last 24 hours, 3 girl children were brutally #raped and #killed in Sri Lanka! Most of the accused are young men below the age of 30.

Child sexual abuse and rape is endemic in #SriLanka with the police, courts and education authorities still doing very little to stem the problem.

The average rape case takes 14 years in Sri Lanka with only 1 rape conviction in 2018.

What kind of men are coming out of our schools? What exactly are our schools teaching them for them to be raping and killing young baby girls?

In 2019, the then Government withdrew an age appropriate #sexeducation book for children because of some made up cultural sensitivity.

In 2018, the members of the present Sri Lankan Government, while in opposition, falsely accused Think Equal of trying to spread #homosexuality to young children.

#ThinkEqual was actually teaching children values such as #respect, #kindness and #compassion. The programme was created out of the need to end violence against women following the brutal gang rape of a medical student in a bus in Delhi.

The failures by our political leaders to address these issues and their active participation to prevent solutions make them responsible for the crimes against these girls.

Where is the justice for our girls and women?",,"Aritha Wickramasinghe

Imani loved sciences and geography and wanted to work as a doctor or a nurse when she completed her studies.

Imani represents tens of thousands of adolescent school-going girls in Tanzania who can longer access education owing to the ban prohibiting pregnant girls and teenage mothers from attending school.

And despite numerous efforts urging Tanzania to lift the ban, lack of political will has been a great obstacle.

We, in collaboration with our partners, have therefore today filed a case against Tanzania at the African Court on Human and People’s Rights in Arusha to challenge this policy and have it lifted.

10158535209849584,"An analysis of Kuwait’s Penal Code released today by Equality Now and Abolish Article 153, reveals the extent to which Kuwait’s laws are failing to protect women and girls:

➡️ Article 182 allows rapists to escape punishment by marrying the woman or girl they raped, a provision actively condones and rewards sexual violence

➡️ Article 153 provides a lenient sentence for a man who kills his female relatives, a provision rooted in valuing ‘honor’ over the human rights of women and girls;

➡️ the Penal Code does not explicitly criminalize marital rape, leaving women vulnerable to sexual violence committed with impunity

➡️ and the definition of rape is reliant on the use of force, threats or deception rather than being grounded in consent.

It’s time to abolish laws that see women and girls as vessels of their family’s honor, and build an equal world that works for our mothers, our sisters, our daughters, our friends, our communities. Join Kuwaiti activists calling for reform today.

10158516330114584,"While child marriage has risen during the pandemic, the virus did not create societal conditions that judged a girl’s worth on her ability to be a wife.

While domestic care-workers have been unable to receive paid sick leave, it did not create an economy that devalued reproductive labor.

While government relief packages have excluded refugees and undocumented immigrants, it did not create political institutions that preferenced the powerful and privileged at the expense of the marginalized.

But what it did do, was force the world to acknowledge that women and girls continue to face both sex and gender-based discrimination. Read more about why we can't let this opportunity to define a new, inclusive future pass us by. ⬇️

10157072823756056,"This is from a piece I wrote 6 years ago after the murder of Michael Brown - Why Black Lives Should Matter to the Anti-Trafficking Movement. Don’t have new words right now. Black Lives Matter.

“The truth is that you can’t claim to be ‘anti-trafficking’ and not be anti-racism. Being anti-racist doesn’t just mean not saying the ‘n’ word or telling racist jokes. It means that you have to actively be engaged as an ally, question your own privilege and address all the subtle and not so subtle ways that structural racism interacts with your life.

You can’t say you care about trafficking victims of color, but not take a moment to understand how race impacts their lives. You can’t talk about prevention of commercial sexual exploitation without addressing poverty and how race and class are inextricably linked in this country. You can’t talk about options for survivors and ‘aftercare’ without acknowledging that those options look different for different survivors. You can’t sit quietly by on the sidelines because all this talk about race makes you uncomfortable. And you can’t pick and choose your social justice issues like you’re at a buffet bar.

All of this is linked, all of it is interconnected and all of this is indeed related to commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking, in all of its forms. As a movement with momentum and interest and a huge amount of support right now, we need to ensure that we’re a movement that is headed in the right direction on all issues of equality and justice, and we need to leverage that momentum to create real, lasting change. Black lives matter, and its past the time for the anti-trafficking movement to send that message loud and clear.”
