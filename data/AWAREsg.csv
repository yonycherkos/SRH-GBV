A MESSAGE FROM THE CREATORS OF SAGA

The celebration of AWARE’s 35th birthday in 2020 called for a reflection on its transformation from modest volunteer group to flourishing NGO and civil society leader in Singapore. In pinpointing the moment that marked the close of the former and the beginning of the latter, there was never any doubt: It was the AWARE Saga. That existential threat (of AWARE being taken over by a group of religious conservatives) pushed its leaders to renew their commitment to feminist advocacy, and strengthen the organisation’s capacity and infrastructure.

We wanted to document the complete history of the Saga for a few reasons. For one, because the lived experience of it was so much richer than what most people saw in the news. And it is important for AWARE to contextualise its ongoing fight for gender equality, to remind itself why the fight matters.

But beyond AWARE, the story of the Saga is important for Singapore—whose citizens pledge tolerance, diversity and democracy in the abstract, but rarely get a chance to test those principles on a national stage. This narrative deals with subject matter that is traditionally considered sensitive in the Singapore context, such as religion and LGBTQ rights. We know that these topics will likely elicit strong feelings in listeners, and have endeavoured to deal with them honestly and with the sensitivity that they deserve. We also believe that our society is sufficiently mature to engage in respectful conversations on these subjects. There are profound lessons to be learnt from the AWARE Saga, about how to disagree constructively and bridge entrenched divides. We hope that new generations carry these lessons forward in the perennial quest to live together in harmony and dignity.

Over the course of this project, we interviewed 50 people. Some of them were experts who provided nuanced, dispassionate insights on the broader socio-political context underlying the events. But most of them were people who had directly participated in the Saga. Living through the Saga was as traumatic as it was invigorating—these interviewees made that clear to us. But while others would have chosen to sweep their trauma under a rug, they recognised the value in putting their experiences on the record. With Bharati Jagdish at the mic, asking unsparingly tough questions, interviewees revisited their triumphs and their mistakes. They relived extremes of emotion: blinding fury, soaring relief, the bitterness of betrayal. We thank them for their honesty and trust.

There are, of course, perspectives that are missing from the assembly of voices—people who declined our invitations to participate. While we regret that we could not interview them, wherever possible we have tried to feature their own words: recordings of meetings, interviews, press conferences, letters, emails and so on. We hope that, in doing so, we have made reasonable effort to present their point of view accurately.

To end: What a privilege it has been to memorialise this remarkable event—and in a medium as intimate and alive as a podcast. May the Saga inspire you as much as it inspires us.

3785658051446606,"We agree with this commentary: Family caregivers of older Singaporeans need help easing their burden of care.

However, the writer fails to identify a major source of stress––financial stress––or offer recommendations on how caregivers can be financially supported to provide care. Our 2019 #MakeCareCount study found that providing care to older persons is likely to compromise the retirement adequacy of caregivers. The surveyed caregivers were forced to completely or partially withdraw from the labour force (spending a median of nine years outside the labour force), and suffer an accompanying loss in income, which they later struggled to recoup. Many caregivers we spoke to said that their stress would be mitigated through an allowance that recognises the work they are doing, i.e. care work.

Accordingly, we’ve recommended the introduction of a Caregiver Support Grant, which varies by the number of activities of daily living with which the care recipient requires assistance, and takes the salaries of paid care workers as a reference point.

What’s more, the commentary’s suggested “one holistic care model” for caregivers and care recipients leaves out migrant domestic workers. No discussion on caregiving is complete without considering both unpaid family caregivers AND domestic workers employed to provide care. MDWs, much like family caregivers, also face a caregiver burden. We need to be concerned about their well-being too, because their ability to deal with caregiver-related stress affects their ability to provide high-quality care to our loved ones.

3782638465081898,"Statement about Theodore Hopf sexual harassment case at NUS

We are happy to see NUS respond with alacrity to an anonymous complaint they received about sexual harassment. Although the university has come under a lot of flak recently for its handling of sexual harassment cases, its decisive action in the case of Prof. Ted Hopf is a clear indication that NUS is taking public feedback to heart.

We want to highlight three actions that hopefully signal a new approach at NUS:

1) NUS ensured that its decision to sack Prof. Hopf was communicated to students and the wider NUS community at the same time as the media. In the previous case regarding Jeremy Fernando, communications to the NUS community were not handled as well.

2) NUS made a police report after speaking to the survivor, and explained in its press statement that it was legally obliged to, under Section 424 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

3) NUS put interim measures into place while the investigations were being conducted—Prof. Hopf was not allowed to contact any students during that period.

We are glad that the university prioritised student safety in this case and did not make any compromises in order to keep Ted Hopf in its employ. While it may be concerning that so many campus sexual harassment cases have emerged of late, we are also glad, at least, that survivors are proving more willing to come forward. It can be difficult and intimidating to file sexual harassment complaints against well-known, well-regarded men, such as Prof. Hopf (who was the top political scientist at NUS). We commend the bravery of those involved.","Statement about Theodore Hopf sexual harassment case at NUS

3726205557391856,"We are proud to launch our latest research report, ""Neither Family Nor Employee"", alongside HOME: Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics. ""Neither Family Nor Employee"" examines the stress (or ""caregiver burden"") faced by migrant domestic workers caring for the elderly in Singapore.

Building upon our 2019 #MakeCareCount report on family caregivers, this qualitative study was based on interviews with 25 domestic workers providing eldercare, as well as a range of employers, employment agencies and training providers. We found that three major factors for domestic workers' caregiver burden were overwork (14.5 work hours a day on average), inaccurate job matching and inadequate informational/emotional support.

Our recommendations to ameliorate the situation include strengthening legislative protection over domestic workers' working conditions, improving categorisation of skills and care needs for better matching, expanding formal eldercare training and creating targeted support resources.
