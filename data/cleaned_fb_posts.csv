What is sexual assault? It is to force someone into sexual activity when they are unwilling, using violence, threatening behaviour, power or coercion. Sexual assault does not necessarily include the act of sex and can also occur when the victim is unable to give consent. Absence of the word ‘no’, does not necessarily mean ‘yes’ and is not defined as consent.

Forms of sexual assault include rape, marital rape, child sexual abuse, elderly sexual assault, groping, kissing and sexual harassment, with all the above causing severe, often, long-lasting psychological problems with the victims such as depression, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, and addiction. That would be in addition to the physical effects suffered such as physical trauma and unwanted pregnancies.

Many victims are invalidated, and even shamed, being told that it was their fault. This may affect how, and whether, they report what had happened to them to the authorities, either to avoid reliving the trauma of the assault or due to social stigma of being a victim.

Sexual assault and/or rape are never a victim’s fault! Any individual can be a victim of sexual assault, men, women, young or old. Although incredibly common, sexual assault remains greatly underreported locally.

If you are a victim of sexual assault and would like to seek support please contact the Victim Support Malta or the Supportline on 179. If you are a victim and would like to report the assault, please contact the Victim Support Unit within the Malta Police Force.

Looking back on the past year, it was a term of many firsts for MMSA SCORA - namely its first student abortion debate, its first fundraising and awareness event for the LGBTIQ+ community, and its first publication related to maternal health, MATERNA! Together with the usual events which stick to our ethos, such as World AIDS Day and the highly successful Peer Ed campaign in Sixth Forms and Secondary schools, SCORA was successful in creating awareness on topics which face much discrimination and are greatly tabooed in today's society. It has become increasingly evident that SCORA's work, now more than ever has become highly relevant and it shall keep up its work for the new term! Whilst thanking the past SCORA Officer, Andy Coleiro and her hard working team for their work in the past term, we now welcome Mick Zammit, the new SCORA Officer and her team for the term 2020-2021!

We are happy to see NUS respond with alacrity to an anonymous complaint they received about sexual harassment. Although the university has come under a lot of flak recently for its handling of sexual harassment cases, its decisive action in the case of Prof. Ted Hopf is a clear indication that NUS is taking public feedback to heart.

We want to highlight three actions that hopefully signal a new approach at NUS:

1) NUS ensured that its decision to sack Prof. Hopf was communicated to students and the wider NUS community at the same time as the media. In the previous case regarding Jeremy Fernando, communications to the NUS community were not handled as well.

2) NUS made a police report after speaking to the survivor, and explained in its press statement that it was legally obliged to, under Section 424 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

3) NUS put interim measures into place while the investigations were being conducted—Prof. Hopf was not allowed to contact any students during that period.

We are glad that the university prioritised student safety in this case and did not make any compromises in order to keep Ted Hopf in its employ. While it may be concerning that so many campus sexual harassment cases have emerged of late, we are also glad, at least, that survivors are proving more willing to come forward. It can be difficult and intimidating to file sexual harassment complaints against well-known, well-regarded men, such as Prof. Hopf (who was the top political scientist at NUS). We commend the bravery of those involved.",long,,sex,sexual harassment,1

November 5 at 11:30 AM ·

Simply Online is pleased to announce our second Guest Speaker.

Alia Whitney-Johnson is an experienced social entrepreneur with fifteen years of experience working with children who’ve endured trauma, sexual abuse, and exploitation.

During the summer of 2005, at the age of 19, Alia arrived in Sri Lanka as a tsunami-relief volunteer. During this trip, she encountered a heartbreaking reality: Girls as young as 11 who had survived rape or incest and had the courage to stand up for themselves in court were often cast out of their own families and placed in protective shelters away from society where they had little access to education or support.

That summer, she launched Emerge (www.emergeglobal.org) as a way to connect the girls to critical life and business skills, healing resources, and a community of support. Since then, Emerge has gone on to serve over 1,100 powerful young women.

Alia is also the Co-Founder and Executive Director of Freedom Forward (www.Freedom-Forward.org), a non-profit that is working to prevent the commercial sexual exploitation of youth in San Francisco through systems change. Through this role, she served as the Co-Chair of San Francisco’s Youth Trafficking Committee for the Mayor’s Task Force on Anti-Human Trafficking in 2017 and 2018, where she started the task force’s first Youth Advisory Board. She also helped form a collaborative of organizations to provide a full continuum of wrap-around services to youth who have or may experience commercial sexual exploitation.

Previously, Alia served as a consultant at McKinsey & Company and worked at LeanIn.org. She has served on several boards including the MIT Corporation (MIT’s board of trustees), SERES Global, Emerge Lanka Foundation, and ATHack!. Whitney-Johnson holds a B.S. in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an MPhil in Development Studies from the University of Oxford, where she studied as a Rhodes Scholar.",long,Youth,sex,rape,0
96,"At Emerge Lanka Foundation, together with our sister organisation, Emerge Global, we work with young survivors of sexual abuse. We value and encourage the young women in our programmes to heal and emerge on their own terms.

We support and advocate for body autonomy, self-determination, and the ability to be the best version of ourselves. We celebrate those who choose to stand up and honor their deepest truths - who are brave enough to claim their truth even when society challenges or harms them for these truths.

No one should be penalized, harassed, or subjected to the inhumane treatment that many members of the LGBTQI community has recently suffered. To those who have lost your freedom or suffered violence at the hands of others, we see you.

We condemn the violence recently taken against the LGBTQI community in Sri Lanka.

To the LGBTQI community, we stand with you and for you. Today, and every day.

Judicial Medical Officers and #Police have been exposed conducting forced #anal and #vaginal examinations on #LGBT Sri Lankans. These exams are done to “prove” #homosexuality and to use as evidence to prosecute LGBT people.

These exams are degrading, cruel and amounts to torture. They have been banned by world bodies including the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Medical Association - WMA. The Sri Lanka Medical Association and Sri Lanka Medical Council are yet to issue any statement condemning these cruel exams. There is no requirement in law to conduct them and the #JusticeMinistry must request all their #JMOs to stop conducting them. The #AttorneyGeneral must also direct all Police to stop arresting and harassing #LGBT people.

In one case the JMO put two of his fingers inside the vaginas of both a #transgenderman and a cis #woman asked them if it hurt. They were also subject to more physical examinations in front of other male nurses and doctors. When they pleaded with the doctor not to insert his fingers inside again, the doctor said that he will light a firecracker next.

It is ironic that the Police want to #prosecute LGBT people for consensual relationships by getting doctors to forcefully probe our anus’ and vaginas with their fingers. It’s very clear here who has committed the offence, and it’s not us! Only perverts order and conduct these exams.

Great work by Daily Mirror in exposing these practices and violations. We can only hope for justice for LGBT people and the victims of these examinations.

In the last 24 hours, 3 girl children were brutally #raped and #killed in Sri Lanka! Most of the accused are young men below the age of 30.

Child sexual abuse and rape is endemic in #SriLanka with the police, courts and education authorities still doing very little to stem the problem.

The average rape case takes 14 years in Sri Lanka with only 1 rape conviction in 2018.

What kind of men are coming out of our schools? What exactly are our schools teaching them for them to be raping and killing young baby girls?

In 2019, the then Government withdrew an age appropriate #sexeducation book for children because of some made up cultural sensitivity.

In 2018, the members of the present Sri Lankan Government, while in opposition, falsely accused Think Equal of trying to spread #homosexuality to young children.

#ThinkEqual was actually teaching children values such as #respect, #kindness and #compassion. The programme was created out of the need to end violence against women following the brutal gang rape of a medical student in a bus in Delhi.

The failures by our political leaders to address these issues and their active participation to prevent solutions make them responsible for the crimes against these girls.

➡️ Article 153 provides a lenient sentence for a man who kills his female relatives, a provision rooted in valuing ‘honor’ over the human rights of women and girls;

➡️ the Penal Code does not explicitly criminalize marital rape, leaving women vulnerable to sexual violence committed with impunity

➡️ and the definition of rape is reliant on the use of force, threats or deception rather than being grounded in consent.

114,"While child marriage has risen during the pandemic, the virus did not create societal conditions that judged a girl’s worth on her ability to be a wife.

While domestic care-workers have been unable to receive paid sick leave, it did not create an economy that devalued reproductive labor.

While government relief packages have excluded refugees and undocumented immigrants, it did not create political institutions that preferenced the powerful and privileged at the expense of the marginalized.

But what it did do, was force the world to acknowledge that women and girls continue to face both sex and gender-based discrimination. Read more about why we can't let this opportunity to define a new, inclusive future pass us by. ⬇️

115,"This is from a piece I wrote 6 years ago after the murder of Michael Brown - Why Black Lives Should Matter to the Anti-Trafficking Movement. Don’t have new words right now. Black Lives Matter.

“The truth is that you can’t claim to be ‘anti-trafficking’ and not be anti-racism. Being anti-racist doesn’t just mean not saying the ‘n’ word or telling racist jokes. It means that you have to actively be engaged as an ally, question your own privilege and address all the subtle and not so subtle ways that structural racism interacts with your life.

You can’t say you care about trafficking victims of color, but not take a moment to understand how race impacts their lives. You can’t talk about prevention of commercial sexual exploitation without addressing poverty and how race and class are inextricably linked in this country. You can’t talk about options for survivors and ‘aftercare’ without acknowledging that those options look different for different survivors. You can’t sit quietly by on the sidelines because all this talk about race makes you uncomfortable. And you can’t pick and choose your social justice issues like you’re at a buffet bar.

All of this is linked, all of it is interconnected and all of this is indeed related to commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking, in all of its forms. As a movement with momentum and interest and a huge amount of support right now, we need to ensure that we’re a movement that is headed in the right direction on all issues of equality and justice, and we need to leverage that momentum to create real, lasting change. Black lives matter, and its past the time for the anti-trafficking movement to send that message loud and clear.”
